## Number Guessing Game: a2-CharlesAntonSibal
A simple number guessing game. Just input a number from 1-10 and check the statistics to see if you guessed correctly! I used flexbox for positioning.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implementing get and post requests to the server.
This was challenging for a combination of reasons: first, I didn't realize that I wasn't running on the right port,
so for the longest time I was getting 404 errors; second, I didn't catch the content type mismatch between the client and server.
That took awhile to realize.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Modifying the array of guesses was challenging because of the multiple type casts I had to do to eventually get numbers in it.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: The first person (my younger brother) to try my page didn't notice that, at first, the statistics became viewable on the button press
because the table was past the bottom of the page. I fixed this by making the table float closer to the input form itself.
The second person (a friend not in this class) didn't have trouble navigating my page or utilizing its functionality after that.
- **Design Achievement 2**: The second achievement was the overall styling of the page.
Implementing borders, background colors, and hover effects to be applied to multiple elements was challenging
because I had to use multiple classes to apply the same styling.
I also learned what rgba was and how to use it for shadows.
